## About the book

For years, I have been asked by numerous teams and gymnasts about online training programs.

However, I wouldn't feel comfortable just sending an online program with exercises. I need to be sure that you will execute the exercises with proper technique and without hurting yourself.

For this reason, I have decided to write a book that will go through both the theory and the practice of strength training in A.G.G. It will have greater depth and be more helpful to you than any online training program. 

This book is for any coach, gymnast, physiotherapist, or parent interested in knowing why and how gymnasts should strength train. 

If you can't wait until this is published and you are interested in in-person coaching in Vantaa(Finland), get in touch with me at: <sergionavadijo@gmail.com>.
