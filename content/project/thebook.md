## About the book

For the last years, I have been asked by numerous teams and gymnasts about online training programs. However, I wouldn't feel comfortable just sending a sheet of exercises with sets and repetitions. I need to be as sure as possible that you will execute the exercises with proper technique and without hurting yourself.

For this reason, I have decided to write a book that will go through both the theory and the practice of strength training in A.G.G, something that will be in greater depth and more helpful than an online training program. 
This book will be of great interest to you if you are a coach, gymnast, physiotherapist, strength coach, or parent interested in knowing why and how gymnasts should strength train. 
It book won't be ready until at least 2020, but it will be worth your wait. 

Until then, if you live near Vantaa and are interested in in-person coaching get in touch with me at: __sergionavadijo@gmail.com__.
