<p>Imagine that you are a gymnast and you want to improve your vertical jump.</p>
<p>By being in the air longer, you will have enough time to raise your legs, extend your upper back and straighten your feet. You will then be more likely to receive a high score from the judges.</p>
<p>If you ask a number of coaches about how to jump higher, most will say “just do more jumps.”</p>
<p>This method, however, won’t get you very far. How could doing more of the same thing that you’ve been doing for all these years give you different results?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” -Albert Einstein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there’s a few selected group of gymnasts that are <strong>genetically gifted</strong> with great levers and fast twitch muscles.</p>
<p>They’ll be able to jump high in the air no matter how they train -or despite how they train.</p>
<p>Even if you belong in this lucky group, you could jump even higher if you train according to <strong>the laws of physics</strong>.</p>
<p>If you were alert in school, you might be familiar with the following: <strong>Force = mass x acceleration</strong>, and <strong>Power = work/time</strong>.</p>
<p>But don’t worry, you don’t need to re-learn these formulas, or even understand them. All you need to remember is how to use them practically. The best way to do it is to follow the 3 rules of jumps.</p>
<div id="rule-1-put-more-force-into-the-ground" class="section level2">
<h2>Rule 1: Put more force into the ground</h2>
<p>The easiest way to develop this ability is to <strong>train against an external resistance</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though gymnastics is performed with just your bodyweight, it doesn’t mean that you this is always the best way.</p>
<p>To get stronger, you need to overload your muscles. This is easiest accomplished by using traditional implements like barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells and other tools that you will find in most gyms.</p>
<p>Many exercises could help you jump higher, but for the sake of this example, let us think of one that you are likely to be familiar with: <strong>the barbell squat</strong>.</p>
<p>The squat is the most researched and one of one of the most time-efficient exercises in modern history.</p>
<p>Study after study has shown that under most circumstances <strong>increasing the weight that you can lift in the barbell squat will have a direct transfer to the vertical jump</strong> (up to a point).</p>
<p>A good number to aim for would be to be able to <strong>squat 1.5 times your body weight.</strong> Most research articles and a few old-school strength coaches swear by squatting 2 times bodyweight, but for a young gymnast, 1.5 times bodyweight is more realistic.</p>
<p>For example, if you weigh 50kg, you should be able to back squat 75kg for at least one repetition with perfect form.</p>
<p>Notice that if you are untrained - regarding weightlifting- a year or more could be necessary to reach that level of strength.</p>
<p>However, <strong>if you can invest in a professional strength and conditioning coach, you will be able to progress a lot quicker</strong>.</p>
<p>Look for somebody with experience that has a track record of results with other athletes.</p>

<div id="rule-2-put-force-into-the-ground-quicker" class="section level2">
<h2>Rule 2: Put force into the ground quicker</h2>
<p>Being strong is not enough, and even if you can apply a lot of force into the ground, you need to put this force into the ground quickly.</p>
<p>The heavy strength training we described in rule 1 will help you but you also need to be doing plyometrics. This is a fancy word for jumps where your joints go through a quick stretch-shortening motion.</p>
<p>An excellent example of a plyometric jump would be the <strong>drop jump</strong>.</p>
<p>The drop jump consists on the gymnast stepping onto a box of medium height -20cm to 40cm-, dropping down from it to the floor and rebounding as high as possible in the minimum amount of time possible.</p>
<p>The key here is the word “time”.</p>
<p>The amount of time where the feet contact the ground before the bounce up needs to be very short -200 milliseconds or less.</p>
<p>Think of a kangaroo continuously hopping on the ground: when it touches the floor, it does so for a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>There is a multitude of different plyometric jumps that will help you develop this quality, but the drop jump is a great starting point.</p>
<p>Another great way to develop the ability to put force into the ground quicker is <strong>lifting medium to light loads</strong> as quick as you can.</p>
<p>Let me take the example of the barbell squat from Rule 1. Imagine taking the maximal load that you can lift for one repetition -say, 100kg- .</p>
<p>Put 50% of this load -50kg- on the bar and perform 5 sets of 5 repetitions, trying to move the barbell as quick as possible on the way up and in a controlled manner on the way down.</p>
<p>Now you are training <strong>“strength-speed”</strong> or <strong>“power.”</strong> This lighter -but quicker- type of lifting in combination with plyometrics will train you to apply force fast into the ground in a more specific manner.</p>
<p>You can be very strong, but if you can’t use that strength in a short amount of time, it won’t help you. Therefore this method is a staple for any gymnast that is trying to develop their vertical jumping ability.</p>
<p><strong>It is the combination of the hevy strength training and the light load and plyometrics what will yield results</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t just do one of them in isolation!</p>

<div id="rule-3-lose-extra-weight" class="section level2">
<h2>Rule 3: Lose extra weight</h2>
<p>Imagine 2 gymnasts that can put the same amount of force into the ground, and they can put that force into the ground just as quick -as the examples of rules 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Provided that one gymnast is lighter than the other, <strong>the lighter gymnast will jump higher every single time.</strong></p>
<p>If you carry excess body fat, that is extra baggage that you have to launch into the air.</p>
<p>Try jumping with a backpack with 3 or 4 extra kilograms, and you will realize how hard it is. Notice I said body fat, not muscle. <strong>Muscle is useful for force production,</strong> and thus you shouldn’t be afraid of it.</p>
<p>Fat, on the other hand, doesn’t have contractile properties. In other words, fat not only doesn’t help you jump higher, but <strong>it slows you down</strong> and prevents you from jumping high.</p>
<p>However, it is important to be careful when tackling this subject with young peole. Even though I am a proponent of gymnasts staying lean, I am not a fan of measuring body fat percentages.</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>most measurement devices are very inaccurate and unreliable.</strong></p>
<p>Second, there is the possibility that some girls will turn the measurements into a competition, which is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>However, if you have access to valid and reliable testing technology and you decide to do it, my recommendation would be for gymnasts to stay in the 14% to 20% body fat range.</p>
<p>If a gymnast is already there, there is no need for taking it further: <strong>the risk of eating disorders is real</strong>, and you don’t want to take more chances than necessary.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to perform like an athlete, you must eat like an athlete.</strong> Provided that you need to make changes, do it the painful way: <strong>Slowly and with the help of a nutritionist</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to perform like an athlete, you must eat like an athlete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main mistake that you have to avoid at all costs is losing weight too quickly. Not only will it lead to binge eating, but also puts you at <strong>risk of injury and decreases your performance.</strong></p>
<p>While body weight and body fat in AGG seems to be a taboo subject in many places -especially in Finland-, other countries like Russia seem to deal with it more openly, weighing the gymnasts periodically.</p>
<p>You need to individualize your strategy and find the approach that works for you.</p>
<p>Some gymnasts and parents only need a small set of principles to follow, while others require a more drastic intervention with daily food logs and more accountability.</p>
<p>Having good eating habits, however, will have positive effects on your health now and in the future.</p>
<p>And definitely on your jumps.</p>
